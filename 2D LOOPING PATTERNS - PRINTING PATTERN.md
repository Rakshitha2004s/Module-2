# Exp.No:2d LOOPING PATTERNS - PRINTING PATTERN
# AIM
To write a Python program to print a pyramid pattern of numbers based on the number of rows entered by the user.

# ALGORITHM
Begin the program. Read the number of rows a from the user using input() and convert it to an integer. Use a for loop that runs from i = 1 to a (inclusive) to handle the number of rows. Inside the loop, use a nested for loop that runs from j = 1 to i (inclusive) to print numbers in each row. Print each number j followed by a space, and keep the output on the same line using end=" ". After the inner loop ends, move to the next line using print(end="\n"). Repeat steps 4â€“6 until the pyramid is printed. Terminate the program.
