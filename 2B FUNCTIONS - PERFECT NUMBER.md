# Exp.No:2b FUNCTIONS - MODULO
# AIM
To write a Python program to define a function that accepts two values and returns their modulo value.

# ALGORITHM
Begin the program. Read two numbers a and b from the user using input(). Convert the inputs to integers using int(). Define a function result(a, b) with the following steps: Calculate the modulo using a % b and store it in a variable d. Print the result using a formatted string. Call the function result(a, b) with the user inputs. Terminate the program.
